```
<arafatm> looking at the api. i have a service that only returns xml, no json.
<jameswhite> put a jimmy on it
<brandonvalentine> yeah, wear your jimmy hat
<rickbradley> someone should make an xml->json translator called jimmy hat
<cardioid> rickbradley: I'll do it.
<cardioid> rickbradley: I mean, it's just tying together some Ruby stdlibs and giving it a silly name, right?
<wilkes> cardioid: except for the edge cases that ruby libraries tend not cover because they are opinionated
<cardioid> wilkes: You think a gem called "jimmy_hat" is going to care about edge cases?
<wilkes> jimmy hats are all about edge cases
<rickbradley> quote of the day, so far
<cardioid> Actually, this can't use stdlib. There's no stdlib XML parser that doesn't suck.
<jameswhite> cardioid: even if there was a stdlib xml parser that didn't suck, It's still suck, becuase it uses xml.
```

Or at least that's all I'm going to tell you.
